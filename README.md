## **Questions for Client**

1. **Financial Assistance**: What exactly should Ross assist with after wallet connection? Do you want Ross to provide suggestions based on transaction history, or just present the data?
2. **Prioritizing Input**: What specific types of input from trusted members should be prioritized? Is it purely based on reactions like thumbs up/thumbs down?
