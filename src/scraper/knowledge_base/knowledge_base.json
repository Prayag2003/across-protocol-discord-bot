            "Across is an interoperability protocol powered by intents. It is the only cross-chain intents protocol in production today, enabling the fastest and lowest-cost way to transfer value without security tradeoffs. Before diving into the technical details, its critical to understand why and where existing interoperability solutions fall short and why Across' intents-based architecture is needed. ",
            "The arrival of rollups and L2s scaled Ethereum but damaged end user UX in every way except price. Developers building on L2s must choose which silo they want to build on. Users must become experts in the interoperability tooling landscape simply to use dapps. This fragmentation will continue as more rollups and app-chains come online.",
            "Across' thesis is that an intents-based design paradigm is the solution to the interoperability challenges developers and users face today.",
            "Any interoperability discussion starts with the most fundamental challenge of token bridging: how can assets be sent from Chain A to Chain B? The naive answer is to “send a message” between the chains. Years of R&D have been invested in this approach, but it faces a problem: it is nearly impossible to send messages cheaply, quickly and securely. Every message-passing protocol today has unique trust assumptions, can only ever be as fast as the finality of chains it connects and has deep implementation complexity. ",
            "What if there was another way?",
            "Intents introduce a third party, a relayer (alternatively named filler, or solver), that does the job of delivering assets / executing user transactions quickly.",
            "An intent is a type of order where a user specifies an outcome instead of an execution path. In practice, intents manifest as a combination of a cross-chain limit order and an action to execute, all encoded within a standardized order structure. Relayers compete on cost and speed to fill these orders, which can include onchain actions as well as assets. Relayers deliver very quickly, without any messages.",
            "From the user’s perspective, interoperability is solved. Their desired outcome is achieved. ",
            "Intents architecture enables filling user orders extremely quickly, but how do relayers get paid for performing this service? User funds are escrowed in the settlement protocol, and are only released to the relayer once the protocol has verified that the user intent was “fulfilled.”",
            "By using an intents-based architecture, the urgent part (filling user orders) is decoupled from the complex part (message verification). The trade-off is relayers must loan funds for the duration between filling user orders and verification, but the benefits of slow settlement far outweigh this cost.",
            "Message-passing is nearly impossible to do cheaply, quickly, and securely.",
            "Intents-based solutions with relayers can fill users instantly.",
            "Slower verification allows for cheap and secure settlement.",
            "Across' intent-based architecture can be distilled into a 3-layered system:",
            "Request for Quote Mechanism: Users express their desired outcomes without specifying the technical steps to achieve them.",
            "Network of Competitive Relayers: A decentralized network of 3rd parties compete to fulfill these orders.",
            "Settlement Layer: Escrows user input funds, performs verification, and repays relayers upon successful completion of the intent.",

This guide is intended to help developers who integrate with Across to prepare their codebases for the upgrade. Please note that this page is a work in progress, and more sections will be added to help with different types of integrations.",
            "Recipient contracts implementing handleAcrossMessage must now replace that with a handleAcrossV3Message call. Details.",

            "Depositors who wish to speed up their deposits must now use speedUpV3Deposit() instead of requestSpeedUpDeposit(). Details.",
            "Across v3 redesigns how fees are handled when creating deposits. In a nutshell, the calculation of fees will be simplified and replaced byinputAmount/outputAmount arguments. This will impact the response data of the API and also how to call the deposit function of a SpokePool contract. Note that these changes won't be breaking short-term but are actionable mid- to long-term.",
            "For a seamless upgrade, there will be no breaking changes for the existing v2 interfaces.",
            "Both will be available, but eventually across.to/api will be sunset, please upgrade to app.across.to/api accordingly. ",
            "Updated from across.to/api to app.across.to/api",

            "It was then expected to call the method deposit of a SpokePool like",
            "The lpFeePct was not required as an argument and automatically derived based on the quoteTimestamp. But if you wanted to show the total bridge fee to the user, then you would have to sum them up like",
            "In Across v3, we need to pass the lpFeePct as part of the total fee when calling the deposit function. In order to be backwards-compatible, the API now returns for GET /suggested-fees",
            "There are no changes to the interface and therefore no changes are required for how you call the deposit function or calculate the total bridge fee. If you want to show the correct fee breakdown though, some changes are needed (see here).",
            "If you want to show the correct detailed fee breakdown, you can use the newly added v3 properties of the GET /suggested-fees response data",
            "Using the values of the new fees struct, you need to call the deposit function like",
            "Even though there are no actionable changes short-term, some change will be actionable mid- to long-term.",
            "As described here, the v3 fees have a different structure now. Eventually the redundant fields capitalFeePct, capitalFeeTotal, relayGasFeePct, relayGasFeeTotal and lpFeePct will be removed",

            "The motivation for updating the function prototype is that partial fills are no longer possible in Across v3, so messaging recipients no longer require special logic to account for them.",
            "If you depend on querying SpokePool events to track the status of bridge transfers, then this section is designed to support you.",
            "In Across V2, a bridge consists of a FundsDeposited event (emitted by a deposit() call) on the origin chain and a FilledRelay event on the destination chain. They must match on all common parameters and the FilledRelay#realizedLpFeePct must be equal to the LP fee at the FundsDeposited#quoteTimestamp based on the computation rules described in the UMIP. Moreover, the FilledRelay#destinationToken also needs to match the FundsDeposited#originToken based on the matching rules described in the UMIP.",
            "In Across V3, the deposit() call now emits a V3FundsDeposited event, which must match with a V3FilledRelay event as explained below. This means that FundsDeposited events (V2 events) will no longer be emitted.",

            "V3FundsDeposited and FilledV3Relay must match on all common parameters except for outputToken. This can be set to 0x0 (the zero address) at deposit time to signal to relayers that they should use the \"equivalent\" token on the destinationChainId to fill the deposit, therefore if V3FundsDeposited#outputToken == 0x0 then FilledV3Relay#outputToken must be equal to the \"equivalent\" token on the destination chain. The Across UMIP should be updated to explain what it means to be \"equivalent\" but this essentially means the output and input token map to the same token on Ethereum, for example they could be the different USDC addresses on different L2s.",
            "Note that the amount transferred to the recipient is relayExecutionInfo.updatedOutputAmount",
            "This is an abridged summary of important breaking changes for Relayers to be aware of. ",

            "The important changes here are:",
            "realizedLpFeePct The relayer no longer needs to set the realizedLpFeePct as a parameter when calling the fill function. LP fees will still be charged to relayers at refund time (i.e. they will receive the inputAmount minus the LP fees) and these fees will still be computed using the formula in the UMIP based on the deposit.quoteTimestamp. This is a nice quality of life improvement for relayers who will still need to compute the LP fee for a deposit but can use a much wider margin of error, as this fee will only be important for computing their profitability and they will not be at risk of sending an invalid fill if this fee is off by a small amount.",
            "outputToken: See the section above about how outputToken must be set if FundsDeposited#outputToken == 0x0. This should be set to the \"equivalent\" token for the destination chain in this case.",
            "No partial fills: it is not possible to send partial fills in V3.",
            "Slow fills: Slow fills will be requested via a new function requestSlowFill. Slow fills can only be requested on deposits where the inputToken and outputToken are \"equivalent\". Slow fills will pay out the inputAmount * realizedLpFeePct, which will be set as the slow fill's updatedOutputAmount",
            "The deposit interface will not change. The function will however emit a new event V3FundsDeposited as outlined in Across V3 Events. The fillDeadline will be set to MAX_UINT, meaning that the deposit will never expire and be refunded to the origin chain. The outputToken will be set to 0x0 to signal to depositors that the \"equivalent\" output token should be replaced at fill time. The exclusivityDeadline and exclusiveRelayer will be set to 0 and 0x0 respectively suggesting that there is no exclusivity period. Finally, the outputAmount will be equal to  inputAmount * (1 - totalRelayFeePct). You can read more about setting this output amount value here.",
            "To speed up a deposit, a new function will need to be used. Previously this was named speedUpDeposit and the new function to speed up a V3FundsDeposited event will be speedUpV3Deposit.",

            "CCTP increases capital efficiency of LP funds",
            "CCTP will reduce LP fees on average for end users",
            "CCTP does not introduce new trust assumptions for LPs or users",
            "How will the CCTP Migration be executed?"
        ],
        "paragraphs": [
            "Across' intent protocol relies on canonical bridges to lend LP capital to third party relayers, who in turn fast fill user orders. CCTP is the canonical bridge of Native USDC. While CCTP is much faster than the latency of optimistic L2 canonical bridges, it is still comparatively slow (on the order of minutes) relative to users expectations (on the order of seconds). Across is migrating to use CCTP as the canonical bridge for USDC, but not simply as a pass-through service. ",
            "Through its network of fast relayers and aggregated settlement, Across will offer faster and cheaper bridging of USDC and leverage CCTP to rebalance USDC at the protocol level with less latency, thus increasing capital efficiency and reducing fees for users without increasing trust assumptions. ",
            "Currently, Across only supports setting Bridged USDC as the inputToken when specifying an L2 deposit. Post migration, Across will only allow Native USDC as the inputToken in deposits, with support for Bridged USDC possible via a swap on origin, prior to deposit. ",
            "Currently, for L2 origin or destinations, Across only supports Bridged USDC (on the origin) to Bridged USDC (on the destination) transfers. Post migration, Across will no longer support Bridged USDC to Bridged USDC routes, and will support the following new routes:",
            "On Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base:",
            "Native USDC to Bridged USDC cross-chain swaps",
            "Native USDC to Native USDC cross-chain transfers",
            "The Across dApp will also support Bridged-to-Native and Bridged-to-Bridged USDC swaps and transfers by swapping from the users' input asset of Bridged USDC to Native USDC on the origin chain, then depositing Native USDC into Across contracts. But this functionality will not be embedded in across contracts or API. ",
            "Eventually, all current L2's with Bridged USDC support on Across migrate to Native USDC support via Circle's Cross Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP).",
            "This migration will require temporary downtime for USDC deposit routes for each chain where CCTP is being added. The end effect of the migration is that all Bridged USDC deposit routes will be replaced by Native USDC deposit routes on the CCTP-enabled chains.",
            "Relayers and integrations must migrate from Across V2 to V3 as a pre-requisite. ",
            "Depositors will be able to use the depositV3smart contract function to bridge Native USDC to Bridged USDC, but setting Bridged USDC as the inputToken will no longer be supported. This might require integrators to upgrade smart contracts to get access to the Native USDC to Bridged USDC routes. The deposit function will continue to work as normal but Bridged USDC routes will no longer be available. Relayers should be prepared to handle the case where Native USDC is bridged to Bridged USDC. The suggested fees API endpoint will add parameters to support the new routes, and all changes will be backwards compatible. Please see the Relayer Migration Guide and API Migration Guide for more details. ",
            "Finally, API users must update to reference host of app.across.to/api and reference the new fees object in the response of the /suggested-fees endpoint. ",
            "Sending bridged USDC between the L1 HubPool and L2 SpokePools is subject to the same liveness period as the L2's canonical messaging bridge, which is seven days for optimistic rollups and several hours for ZK-rollups. Sending native USDC via CCTP will be much faster, completing in minutes. This has several key benefits for the Across protocol.",
            "Whenever the Across proposes sending L2 tokens to the L1 HubPool, those L2 tokens are sent over the L2's canonical bridge and are effectively frozen and unable to be used by Across until they are released following a liveness window. These funds cannot be used to to repay relayers or execute Slow Fills.",
            "Using CCTP to send USDC between L2 and L1 system contracts, Across can more frequently recycle USDC to repay relayers and execute slow fills. This means that less USDC needs to be deposited by LPs to support the same volume of USDC over some time period pre and post CCTP migration.",
            "By reducing the time that USDC is held in canonical token bridges, USDC utilization should be reduced on average, thereby reducing the LP fee component of bridge fees.",
            "Across only uses canonical bridges to send tokens and messages between its L1 and L2 contracts. This means that when Across' LP funds are transferred between L1 and L2, those funds are exposed only to the same security assumptions that users would face if they simply held those funds on the L2. These canonical bridges are secured by the same mechanism that any user submitting a transaction or holding an asset on the L2 faces. ",
            "CCTP is the canonical token bridge for Native USDC. Any holder of USDC implicitly trusts Circle, the issuer of USDC, to not censor their transaction or otherwise \"misbehave\". CCTP is run by Circle, so sending USDC over CCTP does not add additional trusted actors to the Across system.",
            "To upgrade any chain from supporting Bridged USDC to Native USDC, USDC deposits to and from that chain will have to be paused temporarily. ",
            "Next, all Bridged USDC should be returned to the HubPool. The Across owner account will then need to upgrade the HubPool's PoolRebalanceRoutes to point from Bridged to Native USDC for the given chain. The chain's SpokePool and L1 Adapter will also need to be upgraded by the owner to send USDC over CCTP using an adapter like this.",
            "Once all contracts and pool rebalance routes are upgraded, deposits can be resumed for the selected chain. After this point, the only type of USDC to be held on the chain's SpokePool will be Native USDC.",

Users who want access to the new Native USDC to Bridged USDC routes should instead call depositV3() which allows the caller to specify inputToken and outputToken parameters. We encourage all direct smart contract users to eventually migrate to this new deposit function to get access to cross chain token swaps when they go live. You can think of Native USDC to Bridged USDC as the first cross chain token swap supported by Across.

            "Deposit routes with Bridged USDC as the origin token will no longer be supported at the API and SpokePool contract level. We acknowledge that this might remove a popular route for some partners. We are making this change because we believe that most volume will eventually migrate to Native USDC bridging and some partners already implement origin token swapping before submitting an Across Bridge. For example, some partners already swap Native USDC to Bridged USDC before submitting an Across bridge. We hope that this infrastructure can be reused to swap Bridged USDC into Native USDC before submitting an Across Bridge, but we also acknowledge that this won't always be possible. Therefore, we are deploying the following SwapAndBridge contract to assist with swapping Bridged USDC to Native USDC before submitting an Across deposit. These contracts will be used by our own frontend dApp to continue to support routes with Bridged USDC as the origin token and they have been audited already. We understood that most partners will have to upgrade smart contracts to take advantage of this new flow but we anticipate most partners already either implement origin chain swapping or will be happy to replace Bridged USDC volume with Native USDC volume.

The API will infer that the \ntoken\n address is equal to the \ninputToken\n and also assume that \noutputToken\n should be equal to the equivalent token address.

Since these are different tokens held on L2s by Relayers, these limits can differ quite a bit.\nMost API users today query limits and fees before submitting a \ndeposit()\n function transaction directly to the Across contracts. This function only allows the caller to specify a single \noriginToken\n address, which means that this function will not support Native USDC to Bridged USDC deposits. Users who want access to the new Native USDC to Bridged USDC routes should instead call \ndepositV3()\n which allows the caller to specify \ninputToken\n and \noutputToken\n parameters. We encourage all direct smart contract users to eventually migrate to this new deposit function to get access to cross chain token swaps when they go live.

In the example above, the function generateMessageForMulticallHandler can be used to create a message in the correct format.",

            "This tutorial will not implement the offchain components, but it will show a sample contract implementation for the contract that processes the Permit2 order.",
            "Note: the implementation below has not been vetted, validated, or optimized in any way. It is purely meant as an illustrative example. Use this sample code at your own risk. See the comments in the code to understand what each portion of the code is doing.",
            "As is shown in the example above, Across Settlement can be used as a tool to verify cross-chain intent fulfillment in many different setups. The primary advantage is that the integrating protocol can abstract away the complexity of the verification and fulfillment, so they don't have to deal with the security, timing, and asynchrony challenges of building a cross-chain system.",
            "Across Settlement provides additional advantages over naive cross-chain settlement systems, which ultimately lead to better execution of intent fulfillment for users and relayers:",
            "Aggregated and Optimistic Verification: The Across Settlement system aggregates valid fills events off-chain to create a repayment bundle, which is then optimistically verified by UMA's Optimistic Oracle. This verification and repayment mechanism scales gas cost of repayment at O(1) instead of O(N) with the number of fills. This offers an order of magnitude in gas savings vs. other approaches and ultimately leads to better pricing for users and more profit for relayers.",
            "Relayer Cross-chain Management: With Across’ settlement architecture, repayment is made on the relayer’s chain of choice, reducing overhead and complexity of managing cross-chain positions. This lowers costs for relayers, enabling better pricing and execution for end-users. It is enabled by Across’ Hub and Spoke model, where passive LPs extend loans to relayers for taking on time-value risk as funds are rebalanced through canonical bridges by the protocol.",

            "Canonical assets are the only secure way to represent value across chains. Intent bridges like Across Bridge enable interoperability with canonical assets at faster speeds and lower fees than 3rd party messaging bridges without the security tradeoffs. ",
            "Canonical assets refer to the original or \"native\" form of a token on its home blockchain. In the context of interoperability, tokens can either be \"canonical\" or \"representative.\" The distinction generally comes down to the trust assumptions in securing assets on secondary chains. ",
            "Regardless of chain, interoperability protocol or technology, there is only a singular way to \"move\" a token from its native chain to a secondary chain (and it's not really moving at all): ",

            "minting a new token on the destination chain",
            "The critical component in the above flow is step #2, and specifically the verification process ensuring the message is not faulty. The verification method used is precisely what distinguishes \"canonical\" vs. \"representative\" assets. At the highest level there are two verification methods:",
            "Via the canonical bridge: Canonical bridge contracts, which already underpin the security of an L2 chain that inherits its security from mainnet Ethereum in the most trust minimized way, is responsible for verifying messages to mint tokens. These are considered \"canonical\" tokens given they do not increase trust assumptions vs. simply using the L2 chain. Similar \"trustless\" verification mechanisms may exist from Ethereum to other Alt L1s. ",
            "Via a 3rd party message bridge:  A 3rd party bridge, which can have any number of trust models, is responsible for verifying messages to mint tokens. These are considered \"representative\" tokens given they do increase trust assumptions, as users now have to trust a 3rd party to never allow a faulty message (and if they do, it could result in an infinite mint and unbacked token on the secondary chain). ",
            "In a trust minimized world, only canonical bridges, and only canonical assets would be used. But the current speed of canonical bridges (1 hour to 7 days) makes them an untenable solution for many applications. 3rd party message bridges can be much faster, but they come with security tradeoffs inherent in minting representative assets. ",
            "Across' intent-based bridge introduces a new architecture in interoperability that doesn't suffer from the security hurdles of 3rd party message bridges, and is empirically faster and cheaper than canonical bridges. Across achieves this by inserting a 3rd party relayer to quickly fulfill users' bridging requests using their own inventory of canonical assets, and a settlement layer that sits on top of canonical bridges to slowly verify and repay relayers. In other words, Across' intent-bridge decouples the urgent need of fast-filling users from the eventual need of verification. Users and developers don't need to make the trust vs. convenience trade-off in canonical vs. representative assets: intent systems like Across offer the best of both worlds. ",

            "When a user deposits capital to a SpokePool, a V3FundsDeposited event is emitted. This event is now emitted for both deposit() (legacy function interface) and depositV3() calls. FundsDeposited, the V2 event, is no longer possible to emit.",

If this relay hash matches the deposit relay hash, then the deposit is considered valid and the filler will receive a refund in the next bundle. \n",

            "Expired deposits are technically refunded by the next root bundle proposed to the HubPool containing an expired deposit refund. Root bundles contain bridge events for a set of block ranges (start and end blocks) for each chain supported in Across. Root bundles are proposed optimistically as a batch of Merkle Roots, one of which is a list of refund payments including deposits that expired in the deposit's origin chain block range. Therefore, to know when precisely an expired deposit was refunded requires reconstructing root bundle data. This is a complex task and we're working on making this data available in a hosted service with an API interface.",
            "In the meantime, we believe its accurate to state that expired deposits will be refunded approximately 90 minutes after their fillDeadline. Expired deposits are sent to the depositor address on the originChainId. The 90 minute figure assumes that on average, deposits expire in the middle of a pending root bundle proposal which implies that the next root bundle will contain the expired deposit refund. Because root bundle proposals are validated optimistically and the current challenge period is 60 minutes, then on average it will take 30 minutes for the next root bundle to be proposed containing a refund for the deposit and another 60 minutes for that root bundle to be executed.",
            "Fill ETAs for deposits vary based on route and available filler liquidity. For example, most deposit transactions will not be filled until they probabilistically finalized on the origin chain, where the deposit occurred.",
            "In general, deposits that exceed current filler liquidity on the destination chain will be delayed, and unprofitable deposits (where the difference in the output amount and the input amount is insufficient to cover the filler's transaction and opportunity costs) might never be filled until they expire. Expired deposits will eventually be refunded, as described above. ",
            "The Limits endpoint can be called with the deposit information to forecast the fill ETA. If the deposit amount exceeds the maxDepositShortDelay, then the deposit is likely to have been marked for slow fill. To deterministically check if a deposit has been marked for slow fill, you can call the fillStatuses() function on the destination SpokePool as described above.",

            "The relayer is dependent on querying historical blocks on each chain. The RPC provider must therefore support making archive queries. If the RPC provider cannot service archive queries then the relayer will fail with reports of obscure RPC errors.",
            "The relayer queries a lot of events from each chain's RPC that Across supports. Therefore, we use an in-memory database to improve performance and cache repeated RPC requests. Installation instructions can be found here. Once installed, run redis-server in one terminal window and then open another one to continue running the relayer from.",
            "The redis server is used to cache the responses of RPC-intensive repetitive requests, like eth_getLogs, or internally-computed data like getBlockForTimestamp. Caching of data is subject to the age of the input response from the RPC provider, such that a minimum block age is required before it will be retained. This provides some protection against caching invalid data, or valid data becoming invalid (or otherwise changing) due to chain forks/re-orgs.",
            "The relayer bot is designed to use the same account across each of the supported chains. Therefore, the bot can be told to automatically rebalance its inventory across chains and target some allocation.",
            "The best way to demonstrate how rebalancing can be customized is to walk through an example inventory configuration. This example can be copied into a file and configured in the bot via the RELAYER_EXTERNAL_INVENTORY_CONFIG environment variable. The file is JSON-parsed and so must be valid JSON.",
            "First let's look at the \"tokenConfig\". This informs the relayer how it should distribute its token balances across the different networks. Each of the keys of the \"tokenConfig\" object (\"WETH\", \"DAI\", \"USDC\", \"WBTC\") represent the Mainnet symbol of the ERC20 token that we want to automatically control inventory for. These resolve to the following mainnet addresses: WETH, DAI, USDC, and WBTC. ",
            "Diving into WETH's token configuration, notice that it has an object containing \"targetPct\", \"thresholdPct\", \"unwrapWethThreshold\", and \"unwrapWethTarget\" mapped to each network ID. The \"targetPct\" and \"thresholdPct\" instructs the relayer account on Mainnet when to send funds to the network with the associated network ID. ",
            "The relayer is always aware of its aggregate funds across all chains, so for example if the account has 10 WETH on Mainnet, 5 on Optimism, 4 on Arbitrum, 3 on Polygon, then it has a total of 24 WETH. The allocations are: 8/24 on Optimism, 8/24 on Arbitrum, etc.",
            "When the relayer's allocation for a specific chain drops below the \"thresholdPct\", then the relayer will send funds from its Mainnet account to the chain with the shortfall so that its post-transfer allocation is increased to the \"targetPct\". In the example config above, if the allocation percent on Optimism were to drop below 5%, then the relayer would send funds from Mainnet to Optimism to bring its allocation to 8%.",
            "All funds are sent through the canonical L1-->L2 bridges and the logic implementing such rebalances can be found here.",
            "Note that the \"targetPct\" and \"thresholdPct\" are unused for the mainnet token config (i.e. for the row with ID \"1\") but are included to avoid a compile-time error.",
            "When Inventory Management is configured, the relayer will tend to request repayment on mainnet. For example, if the relayer makes a USDC fill on Polygon, then it will expect to receive the USDC repayment on mainnet. This means that over time, the relayer's allocation on Polygon will decrease and the balance will shift to mainnet.",
            "Therefore, the inventory rebalance logic also provides a function that overrides the repayment chain ID to try to maintain its target allocation. This happens automatically before submitting any fill by this function.",
            "The \"unwrapWethThreshold\" and \"unwrapWethTarget\" tell the relayer when to unwrap WETH into ETH to keep enough ETH on hand for paying gas costs. These configs are unused on Polygon which does not pay gas in ETH. Moreover, these configs should only be set in the token configuration for WETH.",
            "If the relayer's ETH balance drops below the \"unwrapWethThreshold\", then it will unwrap enough WETH to increase its ETH balance to the \"unwrapWethTarget\" value.",
            "This logic can be found here.",
            "Wrap ETH",
            "The \"wrapEtherThreshold\" is used on chains where the relayer might receive ETH over the canonical bridges, instead of WETH. Because of this fact, the relayer can end up holding a lot of ETH on L2 and not enough WETH.",
            "If the relayer account's ETH balance drops below this value, then it will wrap any excess ETH above the value into WETH. Its important that this value is set higher than the \"unwrapWethTarget\" for WETH for Optimism. In the example above, the \"unwrapWethTarget/Threshold\" is 0.1/0.025 and the \"wrapEtherThreshold\" is 0.125, meaning that the relayer on Optimism will unwrap WETH if its ETH balance is less than 0.025 and increase its balance to 0.1, and will wrap ETH if its balance is above 0.125.",

            "On the first run, the bot should approve various SpokePool contracts to withdraw ERC20's from it. This is required to fulfill relays. These approval transactions are not \"simulated\" currently and will still be sent even when running in simulation mode.

The relayer can override this setting.",

You can always query it on the HubPool by calling the read-only method liveness(), and only one root bundle can be proposed at a time. So, the fastest cadence for root bundles being proposed is every 1.5 hours. Each root bundle contains approximately all of the relayer refunds up to the current time (as of the proposal) and as old as right after the preceding root bundle proposal time. A 'dataworker' is what we refer to as the agent who gathers all Fill and Deposit events from all of the chains that Across V3 supports bridging to and from in order to construct these Merkle root bundles. A dataworker could choose to propose a new root bundle right after the current one passes liveness, or it can choose to wait. Realistically, we expect that a dataworker will only submit a new root bundle after it contains a certain volume of refunds, for capital efficiency reasons. So to summarize:",

            "Relayer exclusivity provides a single relayer with a time-limited period of exclusivity to fill a given deposit. Exclusivity is assigned at deposit time via the exclusiveRelayer and exclusivityDeadline arguments to an Across deposit, and are emitted as part of the V3FundsDeposited event. The exclusiveRelayer address has until the exclusivityDeadline timestamp on the destination chain to complete the fill with no risk of collisions. If the deposit remains unfilled on the destination chain beyond exclusivityDeadline then the fill becomes available for other relayers to complete.",
            "Speed-based relayer competition can lead to collisions and gas price competition amongst relayers. Many relayer implementations have reached a point of maturity where additional speed gains are difficult to unlock and increasingly encroach on origin chain finality guarantees.",
            "Relayer exclusivity provides a means of retaining the speed gains that Across has unlocked for users whilst reducing uncertainty and risk for relayers. Relayer exclusivity also provides a method of evaluating relayer performance and in terms of speed and availability, and enables a pathway to future order flow preferencing. Relayers are therefore incentivised to do the following:",

            "Relayer exclusivity is assigned by any entity that originates Across deposits. The predominant source of Across deposit attributes is the Across API. Relayers can signal their intention to opt-in to the pool of exclusive relayer candidates by submitting a Pull Request to the Exclusive Relayer Configuration repository. This repository exists as an interim system in order to fast-track the rollout of relayer exclusivity.",
            "When selecting an exclusive relayer, the Across API applies a selection process that considers a number of inputs, including the relayers’ own configuration preferences and their balance on the destination chain. The exact implementation and criteria for exclusive relayer selection is maintained by Risk Labs and is subject to change in order to optimise user experience and minimise externalities that leak value from the system. Recent relayer performance may also be factored in as part of the selection criteria. Third parties integrating Across Settlement are free to apply their own relayer exclusivity selection logic as they see fit.",
            "Relayer exclusivity is being rolled out incrementally in the Across Bridge dapp on select routes in order to trial the system. Performance is being monitored by the Across team and adjustments will be made as required. Third-party integrators are expected to begin incorporating relayer exclusivity in Q4 2024.",
