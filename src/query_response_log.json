        "response": "To detect the status of a deposit using the Across protocol, we can utilize the `DepositStatus` event from the tracking events. This event provides information about the status of a deposit transaction.\n\nHere's a code solution in Python that demonstrates how to detect the status of a deposit using the Across protocol:\n\n\n```python\nfrom across import AcrossClient\n\n# Initialize Across client\nclient = AcrossClient()\n\n# Subscribe to DepositStatus event\ndef handle_deposit_status_event(event):\n    if event['status'] == 'confirmed':\n        print(\"Deposit confirmed for transaction:\", event['transaction_id'])\n    elif event['status'] == 'pending':\n        print(\"Deposit pending for transaction:\", event['transaction_id'])\n    elif event['status'] == 'failed':\n        print(\"Deposit failed for transaction:\", event['transaction_id'])\n    else:\n        print(\"Unknown status for transaction:\", event['transaction_id'])\n\nclient.subscribe('DepositStatus', handle_deposit_status_event)\n\n# Start listening for events\nclient.start_listening()\n\n```\n\nIn this code:\n1. We import the `AcrossClient` class from the Across library.\n2. We initialize an instance of the `AcrossClient`.\n3. We define a function `handle_deposit_status_event` to handle the `DepositStatus` event. Depending on the status of the deposit (confirmed, pending, failed), it prints a corresponding message.\n4. We subscribe to the `DepositStatus` event using the `subscribe` method of the `AcrossClient` instance, passing in the event type and the event handler function.\n5. We start listening for events using the `start_listening` method of the `AcrossClient` instance.\n\nMake sure to replace the placeholder code with the actual implementation details specific to your application and the Across protocol.\n\nReferences:\n- Across Tracking Events: https://docs.across.to/reference/tracking-events\n- AcrossClient Documentation: [Link to AcrossClient documentation if available]\n\nThis code snippet provides a basic structure for detecting the status of a deposit using the Across protocol. You can further enhance error handling, logging, and integration with your application's logic as needed."

        "query": "I am new to across protocol, can you explain me how can I bridge my USDC on Eth Mainnet to Polygon network?",
        "response": "Certainly! Bridging assets like USDC from Ethereum Mainnet to the Polygon network using the Across protocol involves a process known as cross-chain transfer. Here's a step-by-step explanation based on the Across protocol documentation:\n\n1. **Understand the Across Protocol**: The Across protocol facilitates cross-chain transfers between different blockchain networks like Ethereum Mainnet and Polygon. It ensures interoperability by allowing assets to move seamlessly between these networks.\n\n2. **Connect to the Across Protocol**: To bridge your USDC from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon, you need to interact with the Across protocol. This can be done through specific contracts deployed on both chains. These contracts facilitate the locking of assets on one chain and the minting of equivalent assets on the other chain.\n\n3. **Initiate the Cross-Chain Transfer**: You would need to initiate a cross-chain transfer by sending your USDC tokens to a specific contract address on Ethereum Mainnet. This action locks your USDC tokens on Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n4. **Monitor the Transfer**: Once the USDC tokens are locked on Ethereum Mainnet, the Across protocol triggers the minting of equivalent USDC tokens on the Polygon network. This process ensures that the total supply of USDC remains consistent across both chains.\n\n5. **Receive USDC on Polygon Network**: After the minting process is completed, you will receive the equivalent amount of USDC tokens on the Polygon network. These tokens are now available for you to use within the Polygon ecosystem.\n\n6. **Verify the Transfer**: It's essential to verify the cross-chain transfer to ensure that the USDC tokens have been successfully bridged from Ethereum Mainnet to the Polygon network. You can check the contract addresses and chain IDs provided in the Across protocol documentation to confirm the transfer.\n\nBy following these steps and leveraging the capabilities of the Across protocol, you can seamlessly bridge your USDC tokens from Ethereum Mainnet to the Polygon network.\n\nFor more detailed and technical guidance, you can refer to the specific migration guide for API users provided in the Across protocol documentation: [Migration Guide for API Users](https://docs.across.to/introduction/migration-guides/migration-to-cctp/migration-guide-for-api-users).\n\nAdditionally, you can refer to the contract addresses for Ethereum Mainnet and Polygon network chain IDs in the Across protocol documentation for accurate information: \n- [Contract Addresses for Polygon Chain ID 137](https://docs.across.to/reference/contract-addresses/polygon-chain-id-137)\n- [Contract Addresses for Mainnet Chain ID 1](https://docs.across.to/reference/contract-addresses/mainnet-chain-id-1)\n\nFollowing these guidelines and understanding the underlying mechanisms of the Across protocol will help you bridge your USDC tokens effectively between Ethereum Mainnet and the Polygon network."
